# MACVM

A research virtual machine for macOS on Apple Silicon (arm64), in the
**Self → Strongtalk** lineage: a **class-based object model** with an
**adaptive optimizing compiler** driven by type feedback.

MACVM is not a port. It takes the adaptive-optimization machinery both VMs share
(inline caches, PICs, type feedback, deoptimization) and Strongtalk's
representation (classes + direct pointers, no object table), reimplemented in
Rust for 64-bit Apple Silicon. Both reference VMs are cloned alongside this repo
(`../self-repo`, `../strongtalk-repo`); the source-level analysis that drove the
design is in [`docs/reference-vm-analysis.md`](docs/reference-vm-analysis.md).

## Status — working, and it compiles

MACVM boots a real Smalltalk object world and runs programs on a **two-tier
engine**: a threaded-code interpreter plus a **tier-1 optimizing JIT** that
recompiles hot code with type feedback and deoptimizes safely. On the standard
benchmarks the JIT owns essentially all of the runtime:

| benchmark | interpreter | JIT (tier-1) | speedup |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| deltablue | 214 ms | **4 ms** | **53×** |
| richards  | ~205 ms | ~6 ms | ~34× |
| sieve     | 88 ms | 9 ms | ~10× |
| ctxloop (closure/OSR) | 134 ms | 1 ms | 134× |

**Compiler coverage is achieved**: ~98.7% of methods that actually run compile
(the remainder are native primitives, which lose nothing by staying native),
and on real workloads **98.6–99.8% of executed bytecode-work runs as compiled
native code** — including closures, which compile and splice inline rather than
allocating. See [`docs/PERF.md`](docs/PERF.md) for the arc and methodology.

### What's implemented

- **Object model** — Strongtalk-style classes, direct tagged pointers, **no
  object table**, a 2-word `[mark][klass]` header.
- **Garbage collection** — generational scavenge + a full compacting collector,
  both running **under live, moving compiled frames** via precise oop-maps and a
  mixed-tier frame walker.
- **Interpreter** — a threaded-code baseline tier with inline caches.
- **Tier-1 optimizing JIT** — a vendored pure-Rust AArch64 encoder (JASM) behind
  the `Assembler` trait; PICs and type feedback; method + block inlining;
  per-klass **customization** with self-send and block-arg **devirtualization**;
  **deoptimization**, **on-stack replacement (OSR)**, and recompile-on-trap.
- **Closure compilation** — literal blocks compile and splice inline, including
  multi-basic-block conditional-`^` (non-local-return) blocks, with `Context`
  elision / materialization / adoption across the tier boundary.
- **FFI** — Tier-1 POSIX via `dlsym` + shape-keyed native-call trampolines +
  an `Alien` raw-memory type ([`docs/FFI.md`](docs/FFI.md)).
- **Debugger** — crash-dossier (PROBE), breakpoints, mixed-tier backtrace, an
  a64 disassembler, IR dumps, and step-between-calls ([`docs/DEBUGGER.md`](docs/DEBUGGER.md)).
- **Image store** — offline SQLite image editing + a DB→VM boot loader that
  reconstructs the world byte-identically to a `.mst` boot ([`docs/IMAGE.md`](docs/IMAGE.md)).
- **Embedding + GUI** — a `VmHandle` library API and a Cocoa/WKWebView
  Strongtalk-style environment that runs the language on a dedicated thread and
  survives a guest-thread crash ([`docs/vm_handle.md`](docs/vm_handle.md),
  [`gui/PLAN.md`](gui/PLAN.md)).
- **Scripting** — an embedded RUSTTCL console for driving the VM and its
  debugger ([`docs/RUSTTCL.md`](docs/RUSTTCL.md)).

## Building & running

```sh
cargo build --release
target/release/macvm run world/bench/deltablue.mst --world world   # runs it
MACVM_JIT=off   target/release/macvm run <prog>.mst --world world   # interpreter only
MACVM_JIT=threshold=200 …                                            # JIT (default gate)
MACVM_TRACE=stats|jit|deopt|count …                                  # instrumentation
```

The JIT is on by default. `MACVM_JIT=off` selects the interpreter, which is the
differential oracle every JIT change is gated against (compiled output must be
byte-identical to interpreted output). Tests: `cargo test`; the stress matrix
(GC / deopt) and world differentials are in `tests/` and the `justfile` gates.

## Lineage & licensing

Self and Strongtalk were released under BSD-style licenses. Code adapted from
them retains its original notices; new MACVM code is under the license in
[`LICENSE`](LICENSE). See `docs/DESIGN.md` for provenance tracking.
