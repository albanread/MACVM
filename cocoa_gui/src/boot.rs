//! The parked-main boot handshake (`cocoa_gui_design.md` §3, sprint CG2).
//!
//! The chicken-and-egg — *the primary registers the UI worker, but the UI
//! worker must run on the main thread the process started on* — is resolved by
//! booting the UI worker VM **in place on main** and letting Rust own the run
//! loop. This module holds the machine-checkable half of that: the two-VM
//! wiring up to (but not entering) `[NSApp run]`. It touches **no AppKit** — the
//! caller (`main.rs`) does the AppKit bootstrap, builds the window from
//! Smalltalk, and enters the run loop — so [`handshake_wire_vms`] is unit-
//! testable headless (no window server), which is exactly what the CG2 gate
//! asks of it.
//!
//! Boot sequence (design §3):
//! 1. *(main)* AppKit bootstrap + `[NSApplication sharedApplication]` — in
//!    `main.rs`, before this.
//! 2. *(main)* Spawn the **primary VM on a background (watchdog) thread**, then
//!    park awaiting the primary's "ready" signal — [`handshake_wire_vms`] does
//!    both (the park is the blocking `recv` on the ready channel).
//! 3. *(background)* The primary boots the world, becomes a primary
//!    ([`VmHandle::set_worker_boot`]), **registers the UI worker as an
//!    externally-hosted peer** (CG1, no `thread::spawn`), and signals ready with
//!    the boot payload.
//! 4. *(main)* Boots the **UI worker VM in place** (`FatalMode::ExitProcess`,
//!    CG0), loads the conditional `cocoaui.list` layer, takes on its Worker role
//!    (so its future replies reach the primary), and hands the caller a live
//!    [`WiredVms`]. The caller then publishes the thread-local `*mut VmHandle`
//!    ([`publish_ui_vm`]) and runs `CocoaUI startup`.
//! 5. *(main, Rust)* `main.rs` calls `[NSApp run]` with the VM at rest.
