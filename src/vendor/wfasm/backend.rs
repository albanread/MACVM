// Vendored from JASM (wfasm), https://github.com/albanread/JASM  commit 5ac1b1b53d1cfa859e124ff962cf6180ffb72c55
// Original path: rust/src/backend.rs.  License: MIT (see LICENSE-JASM in this
// directory; Copyright (c) 2026 alban read).
// Local modifications are marked with `// MACVM:` comments — keep the diff
// against upstream minimal so re-vendoring stays mechanical.

//! Backend seam for the Rasm migration (replacing LLVM-MC + MCJIT).
//!
//! Two traits split the two jobs LLVM does today, so a native Rust
//! implementation can be plugged in behind each without touching the
//! `asm/` macro front-end:
//!
//! * [`Encoder`] — assembled text → machine code + symbols + relocations.
//!   Today LLVM-MC does this *inside* MCJIT; the native `RasmEncoder`
//!   (Sprint 2) and the `IcedEncoder` bootstrap (Sprint 1) implement this.
//! * [`Loader`] — declare symbols / map host externs / place code in
//!   executable memory / resolve addresses. [`crate::jit::Jit`] (MCJIT)
//!   implements it today as `LlvmJit`; the native `NativeJit` (Sprint 1)
//!   implements it over `VirtualAlloc` + relocations + W^X.
//!
//! Sprint 0 only establishes the skeleton: the traits compile always, the
//! LLVM impls live behind the `llvm` feature. Nothing re-points onto the
//! trait objects until Sprint 1.
